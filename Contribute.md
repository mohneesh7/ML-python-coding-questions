## Adding a new problem
----

1. Fork the repository, then clone it.
2. Create a new branch with a name describing the problem name. Eg. `Two Sum Problem` -> `two_sum`.
3. Create a new folder in the `Problems` directory with the problem's name.
4. Add the problem's URL inside a question.txt file. (Leetcode is supported as of now).
5. Add the problem's solution inside a solution.py file.
6. Add the explanation.md if its necessary. (Recommended for complex problems, else the code comments are enough)
7. Run `main.py` to update the problems.csv
8. Commit and push the changes.
9. Create a pull request.
